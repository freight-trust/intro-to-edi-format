## Forming XSD

EDI standard schemas are derivative products, mechanically generated from the same database as the EDI standard. The EDI standard schemas are designed with an isomorphic approach, meaning that every X12 construct is represented in an XML document that can be validated with the schemas.

EDI standard schemas are a package of four files.

An Interchange schema per X12 version
A Functional Group schema per X12 version
A Transaction Set schema, one per transaction set per X12 version
An internal Code List schema per X12 version
